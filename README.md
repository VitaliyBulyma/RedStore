## Converting static HTML/CSS/JavaScript site to dynamic MERN stack web application

![Landing Page](screenshots/landing.jpg)

The purpose of this project is to combine two separate projects I have completed earlier: 

1. https://vitaliybulyma.github.io/eCommerce-website/index.html which is a static e-commerce web store (Design reference: [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkjoHfkLEy7ZT4bA2myJ8xA))
2. https://mern.store/ which is a Full-Stack MERN application (Project hosted with DigitalOcean. Code Reference: [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-node-ecommerce/))

First, is lacking functionality and interactivity, second is lacking proper design and responsiveness. By breaking down HTML/CSS site and converting it into React components, I will be able to integrate them in Full-stack MERN application.
